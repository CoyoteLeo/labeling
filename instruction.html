                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    There are two articles followed by multiple pairs of short paragraphs (most fewer than 3
                    sentences) from the articles. The two articles are labeled as "Recalled Paragraph" and "Retold
                    Paragraph" with events from the two found below in bolded text.
                    The goal is to label the pair of paragraphs as either "Match" or "Conflict" depending on whether or
                    not the meanings of the two are consistent.<br />
                </div>

                    <h3>Annotation</h3>
                    <h5>Steps</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Read the original articles.</li>
                        <li>Read the paragraphs.</li>
                        <li>Connect the events with the correct label based on the information from the articles and
                            paragraphs.<br>
                            PS: Just drag the dot near the source event to the dot near the target event and the
                            connection will be built automatically.<br>
                            PS: If you want to remove the connection, you can click the "X" button near any end of the
                            connection, it'll remove all connections about that dot.
                        </li>
                        <li>After going through all pairs using the "Next" button, click "Submit."</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>WHAT is an Event</h5>
                    <div style="margin-left: 50px;">
                        An event consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object. Below is an example,<br>
                        <img src="event.jpg" width="700px" style="border: 5px red solid;"><br>
                        The above image tells us that there are two events belonging to the bolded sentence at the top.
                    </div>
                    <h5>Relation Label</h5>
                    <table class="table table-borderless">
                        <tr>
                            <td style="text-align: right;width: 120px;font-weight: bold;vertical-align: top;">Match:
                            </td>
                            <td style="text-align: justify;">
                                The event from both the Recalled Paragraph and the Retold Paragraph describe the same
                                thing, and there are no conflicts between each other (i.e. they can use different words,
                                but they express the <span style="font-weight: bold;">same meanings</span>). Please mind
                                that they're the same things, which
                                means that they must occur at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">same timing</span>.
                                That is, any kinds of causation will NOT
                                be seen as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">MATCH</span>. The following are some
                                examples:
                                <table class="table">

                                In contrast to "Match", <span style="font-weight:bold;">"Conflict"</span> means the
                                events describe the <span style="font-weight:bold;">same event (also at the same

                                only occur at Predicate, but could also occur at Subject or Object. Here are some

                                                In the original sentences/paragraphs, they describe different things, so
                                                there are no relations between these events.
